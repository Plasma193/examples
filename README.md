# Examples
In my goal to become a better overall coder, I plan to do a lot more coding exercises and that example code will live in this repo.

Currently working through their Responsive Web Design certification as well as the Data Visualization and Front End Libraries certification.
Each cert has 5 projects to show that you earned it. Those final projects will be stored here.
