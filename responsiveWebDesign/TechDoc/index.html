          <p>Hey, my name's Luke and I like games.</p>
          <p>Below I'll list 5 types of games I like to play and explain a bit about them.

      <section class="main-section" id="CCG">
        <header>CCG</header>
        <article>
          <p>CCG stands for Competitive Card Games. These are usually head to head games where you play against another person. There is also a collection aspect to the games like there was for baseball cards back in the day.</p>
          <span>
            <code>I specifically enjoy these because they are usually heavily strategy based and there's the creative element of creating a deck that has the synergies in it to beat an opponent.</code>
            <ul>
              <li>Marvel Snap</li>
              <li>Magic the Gathering</li>
              <li>Keyforge</li>
              <li>Yu-gi-oh</li>
              <li>Pokemon</li>
            </ul>
          </span>
          <p>My current CCG of choice is Marvel Snap. The quick 5 minute games and high variance of each game is perfect for a Mobile CCG</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="FPS">
        <header>FPS</header>
        <article>
          <p>FPS stands for First Person Shooter. These are usually team based but can also be free for all against other players or computers. These games put you in the eyes of the character, hence "First Person". These games are usually action packed and fast paced.</p>
          <span>
            <code>I enjoy these games because it lets me play with my friends on a team. We may not be the best but it feels good to work together trying to win.</code>
            <ul>
              <li>THE FINALS</li>
              <li>Apex Legends</li>
              <li>Halo</li>
              <li>Battlefield</li>
            </ul>
          </span>
          <p>My current FPS of choice is THE FINALS. It's an objective based shooter so there's more than just getting more kills than the other team. You have to have good team composition and communication.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Boardgames">
        <header>Boardgames</header>
        <article>
          <p>Most people are familiar with Boardgames. Played on a table in person is the most common. They can range from party games to serious strategy competitions.</p>
          <span>
            <code>I love boardgames because of the amount of different gaming options they provide. I could play a fun party game and laugh with friends, play a team based boardgame and work as a team, or crush my opponents with strategy in a more competitive game.</code>
            <ul>
              <li>Wingspan</li>
              <li>Century: Spice Road</li>
              <li>Axis and Allies</li>
              <li>Dungeons and Dragons</li>
              <li>Codenames</li>
              <li>Dominion</li>
            </ul>
          </span>
          <p>My current boardgame of choice is Century. It's an easy enough game to pick up and play and not too long, maybe a half hour. It has just enough strategy to make it competitive but not so much to be a slog. It's a deck/hand builder which I'm partial to as well.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="RPG">
        <header>RPG</header>
        <article>
          <p>RPG stands for Role Playing Game. That's a pretty broad topic but basically any game where you are the main character and you are making choices that build up your character's skills over time. These games are usually story driven as well.</p>
          <span>
            <code>I like RPGs because of the story and character customization. It is fun to see your character evolve over the course of the game. I also really like the stories you can get in these types of games.</code>
            <ul>
              <li>Star Wars: Fallen Order</li>
              <li>Elden Ring</li>
              <li>Spider-Man</li>
              <li>Kingdom Hearts</li>
            </ul>
          </span>
          <p>The RPG that I'm currently playing through right now is Fallen Order as I'm a huge Star Wars fan and want to play through this and it's sequel so I can keep up with the Star Wars lore.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="CFG">
        <header>CFG</header>
        <article>
          <p>CFG stands for Competitive Fighting Game. These games are usually 1v1 and are what you think of when you see those arcade cabinets. </p>
          <span>
            <code>I play these games because they take training and skill to be good at them. Sometimes they are fun too. </code>
            <ul>
              <li>Super Smash Bros. Melee for the Nintendo Gamecube</li>
              <li>Dragonball Fighterz</li>
              <li>Street Fighter</li>
              <li>Mortal Kombat</li>
            </ul>
          </span>
          <p>I've not played any of these in a while but I was incredibly into Melee in college as were most of my friends.</p>
